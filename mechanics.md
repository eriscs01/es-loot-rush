## Loot Rush Mechanics

### **Core Rules**

- **Duration**: 1 hour total (4 rounds × 15 minutes)
- **Teams**: 2 teams competing simultaneously
- **Win Condition**: Highest total points after 4 rounds

### **Round Structure**

Every 15 minutes:

1. New **Challenge List** appears (announce via chat/signs)
2. Previous challenges are voided—items in chests no longer count
3. Teams race to complete new challenges first
4. First team to deposit required items gets the points
5. Completed challenges become locked for both teams

### **Point System by Difficulty**

**Easy (10-20 points)**

- Common blocks: 32 cobblestone, 16 oak logs, 8 iron ore
- Basic food: 16 bread, 12 cooked meat

**Medium (30-50 points)**

- Mob drops: 8 gunpowder, 5 ender pearls, 3 spider eyes
- Processed materials: 4 iron blocks, diamond pickaxe, 8 bookshelves

**Hard (60-80 points)**

- Rare items: enchanted book, golden apple, name tag
- Nether materials: 16 nether bricks, 4 blaze rods, quartz block

**Very Hard (100+ points)**

- End-game: elytra, shulker shell, dragon head
- Complex crafts: enchanting table, brewing stand with specific potion

### **Deposit System**

- Each team has designated **Bounty Chest** at spawn (color-coded)
- Items must be placed in chest to register
- Moderator/honor system confirms completion and awards points
- Completed challenges announced immediately to both teams

### **Strategic Elements**

- Teams must prioritize high-value vs. achievable challenges
- Resource management across rounds (save rare finds or use immediately?)
- Split team for parallel gathering or focus together?
- Exploration vs. exploitation trade-offs each round
